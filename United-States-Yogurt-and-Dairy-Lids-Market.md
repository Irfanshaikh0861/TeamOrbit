This can include items such as cream, butter, sour cream, and other specialty dairy products. These lids must maintain product freshness, provide tamper evidence, and often need to support easy opening and closing features. Packaging for this category is diverse and can include both rigid and flexible lids, depending on the nature of the dairy product and its packaging format. Manufacturers are increasingly using materials that offer better sealing capabilities and are more environmentally friendly, catering to the rising consumer demand for sustainable packaging in all dairy products.</p> <p>As consumer preferences shift toward healthier and more sustainable dairy options, the demand for innovative lid designs in the "Other" dairy segment is also on the rise.
